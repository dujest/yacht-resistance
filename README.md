## Yacht residuary resistance prediction

Prediction of residuary resistance of sailing yachts at the initial design stage is of a great value for evaluating the shipâ€™s performance and for estimating the required propulsive power.

[The dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yacht+Hydrodynamics) consists of the non-dimensional hull ratios, yacht speed (Froude number) and measured values of the residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement.
